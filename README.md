# SQL Case Study Project

## Overview
This project is based on a SQL case study where I act as a database administrator analyzing sales, profits, and other metrics using three datasets: `FactTable`, `ProductTable`, and `LocationTable`. It includes 29 SQL tasks ranging from basic aggregations to advanced queries, implemented using SQLite for portability. The goal is to provide insights into customer data, such as sales by state and product performance.

## Dataset
- **`ProductTable`**: 13 rows, columns: ProductId, ProductType, Product, Type
- **`LocationTable`**: 156 rows, columns: AreaCode, State, Market, MarketSize
- **`FactTable`**: 4200 rows (sample provided), columns: Date, ProductId, Profit, Sales, Margin, COGS, TotalExpenses, Marketing, Inventory, BudgetProfit, BudgetCOGS, BudgetMargin, BudgetSales, AreaCode
